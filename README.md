>## GitHub stuff

------------

The group was motivated to use GitHub extensively from the start. 4/5 members contributed actively with each their branch, making pull requests to the master branch. 3 of the members had never used Git/GitHub before. The learning curve was steep. Below are a selection of the commands we had to learn.

> git init                                       <br />
  git clone *__url__*                            <br />
  git checkout *__branch/commit id__*            <br />

>## Discussion

-------

>As the project grew bigger we started to notice that more work had to be done just to maintain the project. Also the amoun of work that had to be done to add new features became harder and harder. The main reson for this is that all the game-systems are interconnected, and if you change one part of the game, it will effect more and more parts of the rest of the game, as the game grows. This concept is illustrated on the whiteboard below:
